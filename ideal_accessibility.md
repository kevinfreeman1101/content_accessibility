# The Simplest Way to Produce Accessible Content

If you are a writer or publisher with an interest in quickly generating fully accessible content in any format, please check out the cost-free [Quarto platform](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/). After studying content accessibility for many years, this platform is by far the simplest method I have found for generating accessible webpages and printable documents in [all formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html). 

What do I mean by "the simplest way possible"? Instead of producing documents with specialized editing software, then converting to PDF/HTML/Markdown/etc. and painstakingly checking each document type for accessibility problems, this solution allows full content production using simple text files that are easily converted to publication-quality documents in any format.

## What is document accessibility? 

Fully accessible documents and webpages provide the full range of information to the widest-possible range of information consumers. The range of users to consider includes, but is not limited to people: 

- who can view and interact with web pages without difficulty
- with limited or no eyesight
- with limited or no hearing
- with light sensitivities
- in any category or status who might like to consume your information.

## Why do I need a fully accessible content/document production platform?

Content producers and organizations in all categories need to produce fully accessible content to:

- avoid exposure to unnecessary risk of litigation
- maximize the number of people who can fully utilize or understand the content
- remain in compliance with the full range of accessibility laws without spending years to become accessibility experts
- greatly simplify the publications process from start to finish
- write source documents once; publish in many formats
- significantly reducing publication costs and time requirements while maximizing content quality, usability, and aesthetics


## Why did Kevin create this repo?

In my professional pursuits, I have worked for many organizations who continue to struggle with content accessibility. These organizations are heavily populated with intelligent, diligent, and resourceful managers and content creators who desperately need to meet tight production schedules while creating high-quality content. Trying to read and digest the full spectrum of accessibility standards requires years of study and the interpretation of what defines accessible content is fairly subjective. This repo is my attempt to drastically simplify this equation for friends, colleages, business leaders, and content producers in all categories.

After more than a few years spent studying this subject, I realized that remediating PDFs with Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat Pro wasn't going to get the job done. Most organiations produce documents and publications using purchased software that isn't good at helping users produce fully accessible content in any format. As a result, more costly software is needed which is complicated to use, yet still limited in possible output formats.

There is a better - and far simpler - way!

To produce accessible content, creators need to:

- caption images
- specify document header information (front matter)
- provide quick navigation options
- build documents using logical heading structures
- analyze use of color and document actions to: maximize contrast; minimize risk of seizure in some user groups; ensure that all meaningful use of color is indicated in text for screen readers to announce
- provide alternative versions of complex documents designed specifically for users who rely upon screen readers or visual assistance mechanisms

Content creation platforms generally have built-in methods to accomplish these tasks, but full accessibility requires extensive specialized training and continual use of checklists to ensure full consideration of each of these factors. This quickly becomes a complicated proposition!

Quarto provides a solution for this problem by allowing users to generate content using plain text checklists. For example, [this documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html) illustrates an excellent method for producing PDFs. It's just as easy to [create high quality websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)

Many organizations feel lost in the maze of accessible content production platforms that cost money and often require advanced specialists to use. I recommend Quarto because it is the only solution I know of which allows creators to use simple source documents that convert to any format without losing information or causing accessibility problems.


## How to find out if content is accessible

In short, many automated checking tools exist to help creators check the basics. However, there is no substitute for consultation with accessibility experts and end users in all categories after content is published. For instance, to find out if people with visual disabilities can use your content, survey users with visual disabilities and ask whether they fully understand each specific part of it. Apply the same principle to users in all categories. 

There are no substitutes for direct user surveys that ask specific and informative questions while intermittently giving users opportunities to provide detailed feedback. Once feedback is provided, use it to gauge where content excels and where it needs improvement. With the understanding that perfection is too high a standard for anyone to meet, stay honest and keep moving toward the goal of maximum accessibility; this alone significantly reduces or eliminates risk of litigation while maximizing the size of your potential audience.

To comply with [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), [508](https://www.section508.gov/), and [related guidance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG), organizations are not held to specific timelines or business processes; instead, they are merely asked to honestly assess the condition of their existing content and work diligently to move it toward full accessibility. Reasonable movement toward the goal is more important than immediately being able to meet all standards.
